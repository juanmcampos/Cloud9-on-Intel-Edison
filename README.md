This is a bash script that will download and install the required packages
on the Intel Edison that will allow you to use the Cloud 9 IDE for 
developing the code for the Edison.

Usage:
------
To install the packages, run the script with "install" option:

./Setup_Cloud9_On_Edison.sh install

During the course of installation, you will be prompted with a choice of
installing "ps" which supports complete set of ps commands that are 
required by the Clod 9 IDE plugins.
